## Project Description
The project aimed to design and implement a controller for an elevator using Verilog. The
controller handles inputs from buttons and outputs signals to control the movement of the
elevator and indicate its state. The design uses a state machine to handle the different states of
the elevator, such as moving up, down, or being idle. The state is determined by the current and
next floor and whether the elevator is busy. The controller also uses a counter and wait time to
simulate the time between moving between floors. The simulation results showed that the code
successfully simulates the behavior of an elevator system.
